                        Hi! It's me :). I'm a student and web developer. This app is 95% my doing. I'm main developer and owner of this website.
                        As I play piano, I decided to create this app to help pianists around the world.
                        Since I was 14, I was writing stuff with Midi files and Piano. My first app like this I made in my first class of high school (15 years old).
                        This time, I decided to make something that everyone can use. In someway I surpased my initial plan, but in some ways I changed it to worse.
                        If you want to talk with me fell free to find me on FB, or just contact me using  contact forms on this website.
                        <br /><br />
                        Anyway, I do hope you enjoy using this app!
